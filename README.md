# TriMesh Network (3mesh)

 [Project official website](https://3mesh.org/)

A new anonymous network, alternative to Tor and I2P.

## Why?

Every day, **our personal information is being sold, tracked, and abused**. Spam, scam calls, unwanted emails – does this feel familiar? Even with a VPN, **do you still feel watched or controlled online?**

We’re building something different: a new, anonymous network that’s free for everyone. An alternative to Tor and I2P, but bigger, faster, and easier to use. **A network designed to be safe, private, and completely free**, so you can browse, connect, and **communicate without anyone watching over your shoulder**.

Join us, and reclaim your freedom online.
