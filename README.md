# TriMesh Network (3mesh)

 [Project official website](https://3mesh.org/)

A new anonymous network, alternative to Tor and I2P: **your voice remains yours — untraceable, uncensored, unstoppable, even in the post-quantum era**.

## Why? 

> *Your privacy, your freedom — even in the post-quantum era.*

Every day, our personal information is being sold, tracked, and abused. Spam, scam calls, unwanted emails – does this feel familiar? Even with a VPN, **do you still feel watched or controlled online?**

We’re building something different: a new, anonymous network that’s free for everyone. An alternative to Tor and I2P, but bigger, faster, and easier to use. **A network designed to be safe, private, and completely free**, so you can browse, connect, and **communicate without anyone watching over your shoulder**.

For years, projects like Tor and I2P have shown the world the importance of free, anonymous, and secure communication. We admire and build upon their innovation.

**But the tools we’ve relied on until today — the cryptography that protects our privacy — may no longer be enough in the face of tomorrow’s quantum computers**.

That's why **this network is designed from the ground up with post-quantum security in mind**: to keep your communications private, your identity safe, and your freedom protected — **now and in the future**.

Join us, and reclaim your freedom online.

## Who?



## For who TriMesh is designed for?

This network is created with the best intentions: to protect freedom, privacy, and human dignity.

**It is designed for those who need to communicate and navigate the internet freely and securely, without fear of censorship, surveillance, or repression**.

By providing a resilient, anonymous, and encrypted communication layer, this network supports human rights, freedom of expression, and access to information worldwide.

It is not built for abuse, but as a tool of empowerment for individuals and communities who need a safe space to exchange ideas and knowledge in the digital age.
